    "## Many Kinds of Layers\n",
    "A \"layer\" in Keras is a very general kind of thing. A layer can be, essentially, any kind of data transformation. Many layers, like the convolutional and recurrent layers, transform data through use of neurons and differ primarily in the pattern of connections they form. Others though are used for feature engineering or just simple arithmetic. There's a whole world of layers to discover -- <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers\">check them out</a> !\n"

    "It turns out, however, that two dense layers with nothing in between are no better than a single dense layer by itself. Dense layers by themselves can never move us out of the world of lines and planes. What we need is something nonlinear. What we need are activation functions.\n",

    "Without activation functions, neural networks can only learn linear relationships. In order to fit curves, we'll need to use activation functions.\n",

    "![Alt text](image-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The rectifier function has a graph that's a line with the negative part \"rectified\" to zero. Applying the function to the outputs of a neuron will put a bend in the data, moving us away from simple lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we attach the rectifier to a linear unit, we get a rectified linear unit or ReLU. (For this reason, it's common to call the rectifier function the \"ReLU function\".) Applying a ReLU activation to a linear unit means the output becomes $max(0, w * x + b)$, which we might draw in a diagram like:\n",
